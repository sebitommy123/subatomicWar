 - add right click menu
 - unit move speeds: faster on your territory, neutral in nomansland, slow when invading into enemy
 - make sure cities don't randomly spawn in ocean
 - amount quantity shortcuts (f for full)
 - razing cities should raze all buildings around it too
 - remove scrollable from soldiers

 - mountain defense bonus to 2x

 - make sure you cant stop a city razing if you have just a mine
 - Path finding is broken in some cases on the client, shows arrows through other people's territory and stuff that isn't your territory!

	You choose between Centrism, Capitalism, Communism, Anarchy and Dictatorship
		Centrism is like not choosing anything. Essentially an opt-out.
		If you have the same ideology as someone else, your attacks will be far less effective
		If you have a different ideology, your attacks will be more effective
		It takes time to switch ideology
		Centrism: +1 wood, +1 gold
		Capitalis: +2 gold
		Communism: +2 wood
		Anarchy: +2 wood
		Dictatorship: +2 gold
