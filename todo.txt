	You choose between Centrism, Capitalism, Communism, Anarchy and Dictatorship
		Centrism is like not choosing anything. Essentially an opt-out.
		If you have the same ideology as someone else, your attacks will be far less effective
		If you have a different ideology, your attacks will be more effective
		It takes time to switch ideology
		Centrism: +1 wood, +1 gold
		Capitalis: +2 gold
		Communism: +2 wood
		Anarchy: +2 wood
		Dictatorship: +2 gold
